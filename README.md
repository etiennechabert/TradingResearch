# TradingResearch

This repository contains all the research I conducted on trading algorithm during my 3rd and 4th year at Epitech. At this time the financial crisis was very serious, I was interested to understand how robots were able to take positions on the stock market and more generally to better understand the financial markets.

I chose the MQL to develop my robots, this language has been designed for MetaTrader (A famous Trading Platform). The logic of this language was very close to C++, a language I was already familiar with.

Even if my algorithm was not viable in real trading situations, I learned a lot during this period, particulary on generic algorithm and Data Extraction / Analysis

This work is contain in the trading_robots directory

The news_crawler directory contain a sub-project able to extract financial news from specialized websites, part of my algorithms were based on this news.
